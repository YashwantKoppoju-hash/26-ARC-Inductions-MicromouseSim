# ARC Micromouse Simulator — Induction Task

Welcome to the induction program for our club. This repository will guide you through the Micromouse task, helping you get started with Docker, ROS 2, and basic pathfinding algorithms. 

Your objective is to write a maze-solving algorithm inside `student_agent/solver.py` to navigate a virtual robot through an unknown maze and park it inside the green 2x2 goal zone. 

## Attempt #2

This branch implements online A* with PID wall centring. Start a fresh simulator,
then run `python3 student_agent/solver.py` inside the container. The solver assumes
the initial position (1.5, 1.5), facing north. Restart the solver together with the
simulator for another run. Random layouts are enabled.

The ROS adapter is in `solver.py`; shared dataclasses are in `state.py`, wall PID
and pose estimation in `control.py`, map/A* in `navigation.py`, and movement
coordination in `navigator.py`. This branch deliberately uses multiple modules.
The simulator engine is unchanged; its reported speed can remain nonzero when
a wall prevents movement.

Run regressions inside the ROS container with
`python3 -m unittest tests.test_navigation -v`.
Run ten concurrent random mazes with real ROS message delivery using
`python3 -m tests.run_mazes --workers 10 --ros --jitter --delay-frames 1`.
The headless tests use the actual engine physics and simulated time; each ROS
worker has an isolated domain. Traces compare engine truth with the solver's
estimate. See [Design Spec #2](Design%20Spec%20%232.md) and
[validation results](docs/attempt2-validation.md).

## Prerequisites

You are not expected to have any prior robotics software installed on your machine. Everything runs inside an isolated container. Before starting, please ensure you have the following installed:
* **Git**
* **Docker** (Windows users: Install Docker Desktop and ensure WSL2 is enabled).
* **Docker Compose**
* Basic knowledge of the Linux terminal.

---

## Your Task
1. **Analyze the Example:** We have provided a baseline script in `student_agent/solver.py`. You can run this file inside the container to see how the robot interacts with the maze and the ROS 2 API.
2. **Write Your Solver:** Your actual algorithm must be written inside `student_agent/solver.py`. **You only need to edit this single file—do not modify the simulator engine, maze generator, or any other files.**
3. **Solve the Maze:** Your goal is to write a robust algorithm in the `scan_callback` function of `solver.py` that can consistently navigate the virtual robot into the green 2x2 goal zone on *any* random map layout.

## The 30-Point System

At the top of your `student_agent/solver.py` script, you must set your robot's physical stats. 

You have a strict budget of **30 points** to distribute among four physical traits. These four must add up to exactly 30:

```python
TOP_SPEED = 8
ACCELARATION = 7
TURN_SPEED = 5
SENSOR_RANGE = 10
```

If your total exceeds 30, the simulation engine will crash immediately. You must balance these stats based on how your algorithm behaves—a fast bot with terrible sensors might crash into walls, while a bot with maximum sensors might be too slow to get a competitive track time.

## Installation & Setup

**Clone the Repository:**
Make sure you are cloning your own fork.
```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd 26-ARC-Inductions-MicromouseSim
```

**Start the Simulator Engine:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
*(Apple Silicon Mac / Raspberry Pi users: prefix the command with `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/arm64`)*

**View the UI:**
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080. You will access a Linux desktop in your browser using noVNC. You should see the live Pygame simulation waiting for commands.

**Run Your Solver:**
Leave the simulator running in the background. Open a second terminal window on your host machine and drop into the container to execute your code:
```bash
docker exec -it micromouse_simulator bash
python3 student_agent/solver.py
```

## How to Control the Mouse (ROS 2 API)

We have already written the ROS 2 boilerplate for you in `student_agent/solver.py`! You just need to use the provided variables to read the sensors and set the movement speeds.

### 1. Reading Sensors
Inside your `scan_callback` function, the bot emits three raycasts at 20 Hz. The distances to the nearest walls are automatically extracted into these variables for you:
```python
d_left  = msg.ranges[0]   # Distance to left wall
d_front = msg.ranges[1]   # Distance to front wall
d_right = msg.ranges[2]   # Distance to right wall
```
*(Note: Larger values mean more open space.)*

### 2. Moving the Bot
A Twist message named `cmd` is already initialized in your callback. To move the bot, simply set its linear and angular speeds:
```python
cmd.linear.x  = 0.5   # Forward speed (+forward, -reverse)
cmd.angular.z = 1.0   # Turn rate (+left/CCW, -right/CW)
```
The template code handles publishing this command (`self.cmd_pub.publish(cmd)`) at the very end of the function automatically.

**Safety Feature:** If your solver crashes or stops sending commands for 0.5 seconds, the mouse will automatically hit the brakes.

## Map Configuration

By default, the simulator loads a fixed map *[Seed 67 ;)]* so you can consistently test and tune your parameters. Once your algorithm works, you must test it against random layouts!

Open `simulator/maze_layouts.py` and change the configuration at the bottom of the file:
```python
# True = Uses the same map every time (good for testing/tuning).
# False = Generates a completely new random map on every run.
USE_FIXED_MAP = False
```

---

## Development Workflow

* The project folder is bind-mounted into the Docker container. This means you do not need to restart Docker or rebuild the image when you write code.
* Edit `student_agent/solver.py` using VS Code (or your preferred editor) on your host machine (Windows/Mac/Linux).
* Save the file.
* Stop (`Ctrl+C`) and restart the `python3 student_agent/solver.py` script in your second terminal.

*(Note: Only changes to the `Dockerfile` or `requirements.txt` require a full `docker-compose up -d --build`)*

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Black screen in browser:** Wait 5–10 seconds after `docker-compose up` for background services to start. If it stays black, check `docker logs micromouse_simulator`.
* **"Cannot connect to display :1":** The virtual display crashed. Run `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d` for a clean restart.
* **Solver connects but no motion:** Ensure you don't have multiple ROS nodes conflicting. You can force isolation by running `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42` inside the container before running your solver.
* **Code changes not reflecting:** Ensure you are restarting the `solver.py` script in your second terminal after saving your changes.
